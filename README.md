# Tymbre

## Concept 
Tymbre is an app that allows users to access data analytics from multiple music libraries such as Soundcloud and Spotify to better understand specific musical artists' performance in regards to popularity. Primary factors taken into account are number of streams, royalties, fans, hours played, and number of countries played in. Tymbre also includes its own composite score based on these primary factors that it will use to tier artists into high, mid, and low levels.

## Value 
This app is great for talent scouts and management to discover new artists and their potential. In addition, upcoming singer/songwriters will be able to see what ticks on the high levels, and what it takes to be a successful artist.

## Technology Used 
Spotify API, Soundcloud API, Internal API with Year-In-Review database, User Authentication (Firebase or Passport), MongoDB or MySQL, React, and Python.
